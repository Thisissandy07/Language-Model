This project presents a multi-language text translation application developed using Python, Tkinter, and the Hugging Face Inference API. The system provides a graphical user interface that allows users to select source and target languages, input text, and receive accurate translations using state-of-the-art neural machine translation models. A centralized model-mapping design enables easy extension to additional languages without major code changes. The application includes usability features such as language swapping, input validation, and error handling. By leveraging cloud-based inference, the project delivers reliable translations while maintaining simplicity, scalability, and secure handling of API credentials.
